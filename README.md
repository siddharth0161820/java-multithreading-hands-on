# Java Multithreading Hands-on

This project demonstrates various Java multithreading concepts using practical examples.

## Key Features:
- **Thread Creation**: Demonstrates creating threads using both `Thread` and `Runnable`.
- **Synchronization**: Shows usage of synchronized methods and blocks to avoid race conditions.
- **Deadlock**: Example of a deadlock scenario and its solutions.
- **Producer-Consumer Problem**: Demonstrates inter-thread communication using `wait()` and `notify()`.
- **ExecutorService**: Demonstrates managing a pool of threads using `ExecutorService`.
- **Volatile Keyword**: Example of the `volatile` keyword to ensure thread-safe updates.

## Project Structure:
The project is divided into the following folders, each covering a key multithreading concept:

- **ThreadCreation**: Demonstrates basic thread creation techniques.
- **DeadLock**: Illustrates deadlock scenarios and solutions.
- **Synchronization**: Explains race conditions and synchronization methods.
- **ExecutorServiceDemo**: Shows how to use `ExecutorService` to manage thread pools.
- **VolatileKeyword**: Explains the usage of the `volatile` keyword in Java.

## Concepts Covered:
- **Thread Lifecycle** (Start, Run, Join)
- **Synchronization** using the `synchronized` keyword
- **Deadlock** and its solutions
- **Inter-thread communication** using `wait()` and `notify()`
- **Thread pools** and ExecutorService
- **Using `volatile`** for thread communication
