# Java Multithreading Hands-on 🚀

This project demonstrates core multithreading concepts in Java using practical, hands-on examples.

---

## 🔑 Key Features

- ✅ Thread creation using `Thread`, `Runnable`, and lambda expressions  
- ✅ Synchronization with methods and blocks  
- ✅ Deadlock scenarios and solutions  
- ✅ Producer-Consumer problem using `wait()` and `notify()`  
- ✅ Thread management using `ExecutorService`  
- ✅ Use of the `volatile` keyword for memory visibility
